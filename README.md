## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 80 already in use**
- Change the port in `pfshare.py`: `socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)`
- Access via `http://localhost:8080`

**Permission denied on port 80**
- On Linux/Mac, run with sudo: `sudo python pfshare.py`
- Or use a higher port number (8080, 5000, etc.)

**Files not uploading**
- Check file size (max 500MB)
- Ensure the `files` directory exists and is writable
- Check browser console for error messages

**Can't access from other devices**
- Make sure your firewall allows connections on the chosen port
- Use your computer's actual IP address, not localhost
- Ensure the server is binding to `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`
